# flerovium
How would you like to use an Machine Learning component in your selenium tests. Imagine no longer having to write css or xpath selectors. 

Flerovium brings ML into your tests, by seeing the page like a human, instead of defining selectors, you define labels. Information, which Fleroviums ML libraries use then figure out where to click and type. Those narly xpath selectors become obsolete and you just maintain visual data and flervium figures out selenium.
