How would you like to use a Machine Learning component in your selenium tests. Imagine no longer having to write css or xpath selectors. 

Flerovium brings ML into your tests, by seeing the page like a human, instead of defining selectors, you define labels. Information, which Fleroviums ML libraries use to figure out where to click and type. 

Those gnarly xpath selectors become obsolete and you just maintain visual data and flerovium figures out the rest.
